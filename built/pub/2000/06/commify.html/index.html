<h1 id="span-id-unprogramming-unprogramming-span"><span id="unprogramming">Unprogramming</span></h1>

<p>A few weeks ago I got mail from Bruce, a former student who wanted to take a number like <code>12345678</code> that had come out of a database, and to format it with commas for printing in a report, as <code>12,345,678</code>. I referred him to the solution in the <code>perlfaq5</code> man page, but the solution there uses a rather bizarre repeated regex, and perhaps that&rsquo;s why he decided to do it himself. Here&rsquo;s the code he showed me:</p>

<pre><code>     1  sub conversion
     2  {
     3     $number = shift;
     4     $size = length($number);
     5     $result = ($size / 3);
     6     @commas = split (/\./, $result);
     7     $remain = ($size - ($commas[0] * 3));
     8     $pos = 0;
     9     $next = 0;
    10     $loop = ($size - $remain);
    11     while ($next &lt; $loop)
    12     {
    13        if ($remain &gt; 0)
    14        {
    15           $section[$pos] = substr($number, 0, $remain);
    16           $next = $remain++;
    17           $remain = 0;
    18           $pos++;
    19        }
    20        $section[$pos] = substr($number, $next, 3);
    21        $next = ($next + 3);
    22        $pos++;
    23     } 
    24     $loop = 0;
    25     @con = ();
    26     foreach (@section) 
    27     {
    28        $loop++;
    29        $cell++;
    30        @tens = split (/:/, $_);
    31        $con[$cell] = $tens[0];
    32        if ($loop == $pos)
    33        {
    34           last;
    35        }
    36        $cell++;
    37        $con[$cell] = &quot;,&quot;;
    38     }
    39     return @con;
    40  }
</code></pre>

<p>Bruce described this as &ldquo;Probably pretty crude and bulky.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d have to agree. 40 lines is pushing the limit for a readable function, and there&rsquo;s no reason why something this simple should have to be so large. Bruce has done a lot of programming work here and produced a lot of code; let&rsquo;s see if we can unprogram some of this and end up with less code than we started with.</p>

<pre><code>    5      $result = ($size / 3);
    6      @commas = split (/\./, $result);
    7      $remain = ($size - ($commas[0] * 3));
</code></pre>

<p>Right up front is probably the single weirdest piece of code in the whole program. I know it&rsquo;s weird because the first time I saw it I realized what it did right away, but when I revisited the program a couple of weeks later, I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out at all. Bruce knows that the digits in the original number will be divided into groups of three, with a group of leftover digits at the beginning. He wants to know how many digits, possibly zero, will be in that first group. To do that, he needs to divide by three and find the remainder.</p>

<p>Bruce has done something ingenious here: The code here divides <code>$size</code> by 3, and supposes that the result will be a decimal number. Then it gets the integer part with <code>split</code>, splitting on the decimal point character!</p>

<p>Perl already has a much simpler way to get the remainder: The <code>%</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>        $remain = $size % 3;   # This gets the remainder after division.
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth remembering that Perl has an <code>int()</code> function which throws away the fractional part of a number and returns the integer part . This is essentially what the <code>split</code> was doing here.</p>

<p>A useful rule of thumb is that it&rsquo;s peculiar to treat a number like a string, and whenever you do pattern matching on a number, you should be suspicious. There&rsquo;s almost always a more natural way to get the same result. For example</p>

<pre><code>        if ($num =~ /^-/) { it is less than zero }
</code></pre>

<p>is bizarre and obfuscatory; it should be</p>

<pre><code>        if ($num &lt; 0) { it is less than zero }

     8     $pos = 0;
     9     $next = 0;
    10     $loop = ($size - $remain);
    11     while ($next &lt; $loop)
    12     {
    13        if ($remain &gt; 0)
    14        {
    15           $section[$pos] = substr($number, 0, $remain);
    16           $next = $remain++;
    17           $remain = 0;
    18           $pos++;
    19        }
    20        $section[$pos] = substr($number, $next, 3);
    21        $next = ($next + 3);
    22        $pos++;
    23     }
</code></pre>

<p>Now here we have a <code>while</code> loop with an <code>if</code> condition inside it. The <code>if</code> condition is that <code>$remain</code> be positive. Inside the <code>if</code> block, <code>$remain</code> is set to 0, and it doesn&rsquo;t change anywhere else in this section of code. So we can deduce that the `if&rsquo; block will only be executed on the first trip through the loop, because after that, <code>$remain</code> will be 0.</p>

<p>That suggests that we should do the <code>if</code> part <em>before</em> we start the loop, because then we won&rsquo;t have to test <code>$remain</code> every time. Then the structure is simpler, because we can move the <code>if</code> block out of the <code>while</code> block, and even a little shorter because we don&rsquo;t need the code that manages <code>$remain</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    $next = 0;
    $pos = 0;
    if ($remain &gt; 0)
    {
       $section[$pos] = substr($number, 0, $remain);
       $next = $remain + 1;
       $pos++;
    }

    $loop = ($size - $remain);
    while ($next &lt; $loop)
    {
       $section[$pos] = substr($number, $next, 3);
       $next = ($next + 3);
       $pos++;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>while</code> loop we see another case of a common beginner error I pointed out in the last article. Whenever you have a variable like <code>$pos</code> that only exists to keep track of where the end of an array is, you should get rid of it. Here, for example, the only use for <code>$pos</code> is to add a new element to the end of <code>@section</code>. But the <code>push</code> function does that already, without needing <code>$pos</code>. Whenever you have code that looks like</p>

<pre><code>        $array[$pos] = SOMETHING;
        $pos++;
</code></pre>

<p>you should see if it can be replaced with</p>

<pre><code>        push @array, SOMETHING;
</code></pre>

<p>97% of the time, it <em>can</em> be replaced. Here, the result is:</p>

<pre><code>    $next = 0;
    if ($remain &gt; 0)
    {
       push @section, substr($number, 0, $remain);
       $next = $remain + 1;
    }

    $loop = ($size - $remain);
    while ($next &lt; $loop)
    {
       push @section, substr($number, $next, 3);
       $next = ($next + 3);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>At this point in the code, I had an inspiration. <code>$pos</code> was just a special case of a more general principle at work. In every program, there are two kinds of code. Every bit of code is either naturally related to the problem at hand, or else it&rsquo;s an accidental side effect of the fact that you happened to solve the problem using a digital computer. This second kind of code is just scaffolding. The goal of all programming is to reduce this accidental, synthetic code so that the natural, essential code is more visible.</p>

<p><code>$pos</code> is a perfect example of synthetic code. It has nothing to do with adding commas to an input. It&rsquo;s only there because we happened to use an array to hold the chunks of the original input, and arrays are indexed by numbers. Array index variables are almost always synthetic.</p>

<p>Good languages provide many ways to reduce synthetic code. Here&rsquo;s an example. Suppose you have two variables, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and you want to switch their values. In C, you would have to declare a third variable, and then do this:</p>

<pre><code>        c = b;
        b = a;
        a = c;
</code></pre>

<p>The extra variable here is totally synthetic. It has nothing at all to do with what you really want to do, which is switch the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. In Perl, you can say</p>

<pre><code>        ($a, $b) = ($b, $a);
</code></pre>

<p>and omit the synthetic variable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how sometimes it can be so much easier to think about something once you have a name for it. Once I had this inspiration about synthetic code, I suddenly started seeing it everywhere. I noticed right away that <code>$next</code> and <code>$loop</code> were synthetic, and I started to wonder if I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of them. Not only are they both synthetic, but they&rsquo;re used for the same purpose, namely to control the exiting of the <code>while</code> loop. Two variables to control one loop is excessive; in most cases you only need one variable to control one loop. If there are two, as in this case, it&rsquo;s almost always possible to eliminate one or combine them. Here it turns out that <code>$loop</code> is just useless, and we could have been using <code>$size</code> instead. <code>$size</code> is rather natural, because it&rsquo;s simply the length of the input, and using <code>length($number)</code> is more natural still.</p>

<pre><code>    if ($remain &gt; 0)
    {
       push @section, substr($number, 0, $remain);
    }
    $next = $remain;

    while ($next &lt; length($number))
    {
       push @section, substr($number, $next, 3);
       $next += 3;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the condition on the while loop is much easier to understand, because there&rsquo;s no peculiar and meaningless <code>$loop</code> variable: ``While the current position in the string is not past the end, get another section.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also changed <code>$next = $next + 3</code> to <code>$next += 3</code> which is more concise.</p>

<p>Now we have two variables, <code>$next</code> and <code>$remain</code>, which only overlap at once place, and at that one place (the assignment) they mean the same thing. So let&rsquo;s let one variable do the work of two:</p>

<pre><code>    if ($remain &gt; 0)
    {
       push @section, substr($number, 0, $remain);
    }

    while ($remain &lt; length($number))
    {
       push @section, substr($number, $remain, 3);
       $remain += 3;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The code is not going to get much simpler than this. We have turned twelve lines into five.</p>

<h2 id="span-id-assembling-the-result-assembling-the-result-span"><span id="assembling the result">Assembling the Result</span></h2>

<pre><code>    24     $loop = 0;
    25     @con = ();
    26     foreach (@section) 
    27     {
    28        $loop++;
    29        $cell++;
    30        @tens = split (/:/, $_);
    31        $con[$cell] = $tens[0];
    32        if ($loop == $pos)
    33        {
    34           last;
    35        }
    36        $cell++;
    37        $con[$cell] = &quot;,&quot;;
    38     }
    39     return @con;
    40  }
</code></pre>

<p>Here we want to construct the result list, <code>@con</code>, from the list that has the sections in it. I couldn&rsquo;t understand what the <code>@tens</code> array is for, or why the code is looking for <code>:</code> characters, which don&rsquo;t normally appear in numerals. The original program turns <code>1234:5678</code> into <code>123,4,678</code>, which I can&rsquo;t believe was what was wanted. I asked Bruce what he was up to here, but I didn&rsquo;t have enough context to understand his response&mdash;I had the impression that it was an incompletely implemented feature. So I took it out and left behind a comment.</p>

<p><code>$cell</code> is another variable whose only purpose is to track the length of an array, so we can eliminate it by using <code>push</code> the same way we did before:</p>

<pre><code>    foreach (@section) 
    {
       $loop++;
       push @con, $_;
       # Warning: no longer handles ':' characters

       if ($loop == $pos)
       {
          last;
       }
       push @con, ',' ;
    }
    return @con;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the only use of the <code>$loop</code> variable is to escape the loop before adding a comma to the last element. Let&rsquo;s simply get rid of it. Then when we leave the loop, there is an extra comma at the end of the array, but it&rsquo;s easier to clean up the extra comma afterwards than it was to keep track of the loop:</p>

<pre><code>    foreach (@section) 
    {
       push @con, $_, ',';
    }
    pop @con;
    return @con;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think this loop is going to get much smaller.</p>

<p>What we have now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    # Warning: No longer handles ':' characters
    sub conversion 
    { 
      my ($number) = @_;
      my $remain = length($number) % 3;

      if ($remain &gt; 0)
      {
         @section = (substr($number, 0, $remain));
      }

      while ($remain &lt; length $number)
      {
         push @section, substr($number, $remain, 3);
         $remain += 3;
      }

      foreach (@section) 
      {
         push @con, $_, ',';
      }
      pop @con;
      return @con;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is a big improvement already, but more improvement is possible. <code>@section</code> is a synthetic variable; it&rsquo;s only there so we can loop over it, and then we throw it away at the end. It would be better to construct <code>@con</code> directly, without having to build <code>@section</code> first. Now that the code is so simple, it&rsquo;s much easier to see how to do this. In the original program, one loop breaks the input into chunks, and the other loop inserts commas. We can replace these two loops with a single loop that does both tasks, so that this:</p>

<pre><code>      while ($remain &lt; $size)
      {
         push @section, substr($number, $remain, 3);
         $remain += 3;
      } 

      foreach (@section) 
      {
         push @con, $_, ',';
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes this:</p>

<pre><code>      while ($remain &lt; $size)
      {
         push @con, substr($number, $remain, 3), ',';
         $remain += 3;
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Eliminating the second loop means that the special case <code>if</code> block at the beginning must insert its own comma if it is exercised:</p>

<pre><code>      if ($remain &gt; 0)
      {
         push @con, substr($number, 0, $remain), ',';
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Eliminating the second loop also has the pleasant side effect of making the function faster, since it no longer has to make two passes over the input. The finished version of the function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    # Warning: No longer handles ':' characters
    sub conversion 
    { 
      my ($number) = @_;
      my $size = length($number);
      my $remain = $size % 3;
      my @con = ();

      if ($remain &gt; 0)
      {
         push @con, substr($number, 0, $remain), ',';
      }

      while ($remain &lt; $size)
      {
         push @con, substr($number, $remain, 3), ',';
         $remain += 3;
      }

      pop @con;
      return @con;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is a big win. A 30-line function has turned into a 12-line function. Formerly, it had nine scalar variables and four arrays; now it has three scalars and one array. If we wanted, we could reduce it more by eliminating <code>$size</code>, which is somewhat synthetic, and using <code>length($number)</code> in the rest of the function instead. The gain seemed smaller, so I didn&rsquo;t choose to do it.</p>

<p>In good code, the structure of the program is in harmony with the structure of the data. Here the structure of the code corresponds directly to the structure of the result we are trying to produce. We wanted to turn an input like <code>12345678</code> into an output like <code>12 , 345 , 678</code>. There is a single <code>if</code> block up front to handle the special case of the initial digit group, which might be different from the other groups, and then there is a single <code>while</code> loop to handle the rest of the groups.</p>

<p>The really funny thing about this code is that I hardly had to use any of Perl&rsquo;s special features at all. The cleanup came entirely from reorganizing the existing code and removing unnecessary items. Of course, Perl features like <code>push</code> made it easy to eliminate synthetic variables and other code that would have been necessary in other languages.</p>

<p>For a more &lsquo;Perlish&rsquo; (and unfortunately obfuscated) solution to this problem see the FAQ.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="span-id-red-flags-red-flags-span"><span id="red flags">Red Flags</span></h1>

<p>A red flag is a warning sign that something is wrong. When you see a red flag, you should immediately consider whether you have an opportunity to make the code cleaner. I liked this program because it raised many red flags.</p>

<h2 id="span-id-eliminate-synthetic-code-eliminate-synthetic-code-span"><span id="eliminate synthetic code">Eliminate synthetic code</span></h2>

<p>Some parts of your program relate directly to the problem you are trying to solve. This is natural code. But some parts of the program relate only to other parts of the program; this is synthetic code. An example is a loop control variable. You can tell from its name that it&rsquo;s synthetic. It&rsquo;s not there to solve your problem; it&rsquo;s there to control a loop, and the <em>loop</em> is there to help solve the problem. You might care about the loop, but the control variable is an inconvenience, only there for bookkeeping.</p>

<h2 id="span-id-beware-of-special-cases-in-loops-beware-of-special-cases-in-loops-span"><span id="beware of special cases in loops">Beware of special cases in loops</span></h2>

<p>If you have a loop with a special test to do something on the first or last iteration, you may be able to get rid of it. First-iteration code can often be hoisted out of the loop into a separate initialization section. Last-iteration code can often be hoisted down and performed after the loop is finished. If the loop runs a little too much code, undoing the extra is often simpler than trying to escape the loop prematurely.</p>

<h2 id="span-id-don-t-apply-string-operations-to-numbers-don-t-apply-string-operations-to-numbers-span"><span id="don't apply string operations to numbers">Don&rsquo;t apply string operations to numbers</span></h2>

<p>Treating a number as a string of digits is a bizarre thing to do, because the digits themselves don&rsquo;t really have much to do with the value of the number. Doing so creates a string version of the numeric quantity, which usually means you went down the wrong path, because Perl numbers are stored internally in a numeric form that should support all the numeric operations you should want.</p>

<p>If you used a regex, or <code>split</code>, <code>substr</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>length</code>, or any other string function on a number, that is a red flag. Stop and consider whether there might be a more natural and robust way to do the same thing using only numeric operations. For example, this is bizarre:</p>

<pre><code>        if (length($number) &gt; 3) { large number }
</code></pre>

<p>It is more natural to write this instead:</p>

<pre><code>        if ($number &gt;= 1000)      { large number }
</code></pre>

<p>An exception to this is when you really are treating a number as a string, such as when you&rsquo;re writing it into a fixed-width field. Examples of both cases occur in the program in this article. In the original, using <code>split</code> to compute the modulus operator was unnatural. In the final version, we do indeed apply <code>length()</code> and <code>substr()</code> to <code>$number</code>, but that&rsquo;s because we really do want to treat the number as a digit string, splitting it up into groups of three digits and inserting commas.</p>

<p>Still, the red flag is there, and so we should see what happens if we heed it, and try to replace <code>length()</code> and <code>substr()</code> with truly numeric operations. The result:</p>

<pre><code>        # Warning: No longer handles ':' characters.
        sub convert {
          my ($number) = shift;
          my @result;
          while ($number) {
            push @result, ($number % 1000) , ',';
            $number = int($number/1000);
          }
          pop @result;      # Remove trailing comma
          return reverse @result;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Notice again how it&rsquo;s easier to pop an extra comma off the end of <code>@result</code> afterwards than it is to special-case the first iteration of the loop to avoid adding the comma in the first place. The code now has eight lines, one scalar, and one array. I think this qualifies as a win! The lesson to learn here is: When in doubt, try writing it both ways!</p>
