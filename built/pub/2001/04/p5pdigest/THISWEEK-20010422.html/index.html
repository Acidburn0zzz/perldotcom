<h3 id="span-id-modules-in-the-core-modules-in-the-core-span"><span id="Modules_in_the_core">Modules in the core</span></h3>

<p>Jarkko faced the allegations of bloat after having added <code>Scalar-List-Utils</code> to the core head on, with a list of <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-04/msg00806.html">proposed module additions</a>. This, inevitably, sparked a huge thread. The main argument was not about bloat per se, but about the less of a clear sense of who is responsible for a module, especially if it has a separate life on CPAN, and how updates would get fed back.</p>

<p>Paul Marquess remarked that he wanted to put the <code>zlib</code> source into the <code>Compress::Zlib</code> distribution, which would make it suitable for core-ification so that <code>CPAN.pm</code> can deal with compressed files. Unfortunately, the source is big, not really as portable as Perl. Another suggestion was to add a configure probe for <code>-lz</code> when Perl was being built, and build <code>Compress::Zlib</code>. Nick Clark has been working on a compression/decompression PerlIO filter, but this too would use <code>libz</code>. The comparison between this and the <code>-lgdbm</code> dependency of <code>GDBM_File</code> led to talk of an <code>AnyCompress</code> library which had pure Perl decompression fallbacks. A good summary of that part of the discussion is given in <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-04/msg01121.html">this message</a> by Nick Clark.</p>

<p>Anton Berezin remarked that FreeBSD was going to break up 5.6.1 into essential core components and additional &ldquo;ports&rdquo;. This worried a couple of people until they remembered that Debian has been doing just this as well, and Joe Karthauser pointed out that breaking off core modules into separate ports would allow them to be updated independently of the Perl version.</p>

<p>Larry said that requiring <code>expat</code> wasn&rsquo;t too much of an impediment to <code>XML::Parser</code> being included, because XML is everywhere these days. Nat noted that Paul Kulchenko wrote a pure-Perl parser, <code>XML::Parser::Lite</code> which could also be contributed to core. Dan Brian astutely pointed out that if someone&rsquo;s got expat installed and they&rsquo;ll be doing XML things, it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;ll have <code>XML::Parser</code> anyway, so there isn&rsquo;t much point in having a pure-Perl fallback. Matt Sergeant reminded us that there isn&rsquo;t a consensus on the &ldquo;best&rdquo; XML API module, so we can&rsquo;t really include one of them either.</p>

<p>Larry wanted to talk with Paul about how slow <code>XML::Parser::Lite</code> turned out to be, presumably to help him decide about regular expression strategies for Perl 6.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-kwalitee-control-kwalitee-control-span"><span id="Kwalitee_Control">Kwalitee Control</span></h3>

<p>Perl&rsquo;s Quality Control department - Mr. Schwern - was in full flow this week; first he found that one of the test suites had some special-case <code>@INC</code> handling for Mac. If this was needed, he argued, why wasn&rsquo;t it needed for all of the tests? And if it was needed for all of the tests, why not abstract it out into a separate module? Since the <code>TEST</code> harness automatically loads <code>TestInit.pm</code> anyway, why not use that? Chris Nandor was in agreement, but pointed out that you&rsquo;d still have to remove the <code>@INC</code> modifications from all the test scripts, because they would run after <code>TestInit</code> had done its modifications.</p>

<p>He also suggested that <code>Test::Simple</code> and <code>Test::More</code> were put into the core. Nobody had any comments on that.</p>

<p>Next, he removed the &ldquo;compilation&rdquo; tests from <code>t/lib/1_compile.t</code> for those modules which already have tests. Jarkko suggested that this would have to keep happening periodically, and wanted a cleverer solution, but Schwern thought of a better one - WRITE MORE TESTS!</p>

<p>He then produced a <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-04/msg01218.html">list</a> of all the modules which were untested, and offered an <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-04/msg01223.html">incentive</a> - once all the modules have sufficient tests, Schwern will donate $500 dollars to <a href="http://www.yetanother.org/">Yet Another Society</a>. Get to it and deprive this man of his hard earned cash! There may even be prizes in it for you&hellip;</p>

<p>He also proposed two pretty uncontroversial (well, by most people&rsquo;s standards) standards for new modules coming into the core: that they should have some documentation and a reasnoable amount of tests. Schwern said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get any more elaborate for the moment to avoid lengthy debate.&rdquo; This didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Peter Prymmer had Perl avoid testing the new <code>List::Utils</code> module on platforms which hadn&rsquo;t built the XS code for it. Graham Barr briefly objected, saying that it should fallback to pure Perl replacements; however, if they weren&rsquo;t built, these replacements wouldn&rsquo;t be moved to <code>lib/</code>. When he realised that the fallbacks were there for those people who didn&rsquo;t have compilers, and that you tend to have a compiler handy during the Perl build process, he withdrew his objection.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-regex-debugger-and-reference-type-regex-debugger-and-reference-type-span"><span id="Regex_Debugger_and_Reference_Type">Regex Debugger and Reference Type</span></h3>

<p>Mark-Jason Dominus has been working on the regular expression debugger for ActiveState&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/Komodo/More">Komodo</a> IDE - it allows you to, for example, set breakpoints in a regular expression. However, one of the problems he came across was relating the positions of the nodes of the compiled regular expression ( <code>ANYOF</code>, <code>EXACT</code>, and so on.) to character offsets in the string representation of it. For instance, if you have <code>/([\d.]+)f/</code> your debugger will want to stop at the &ldquo;f&rdquo;. To do this, the compiled form will need to know where the &ldquo;f&rdquo; is. To provide this, he submitted a patch which</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s put back a patch which generates an array of offsets every time a regular expression is compiled; he also patched <code>perldebguts</code> to <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-04/msg01240.html">explain how it all works.</a></p>

<p>As well as this, MJD noticed a problem with the debugging output for regular expressions: when you have a character class, Perl uses a bitmask to note which characters you&rsquo;re matching. It used to be 256 bits, one for each character. However, with UTF8 regular expressions, that bitmask now needs to be a lot wider than it used to be. However, the debugger didn&rsquo;t know about this new wide bitmask, and was still only skipping over 256 bits, landing somewhere in the middle of the Unicode bitmask. If the bits at this point were set to zero, which is likely, the debugger would interpret it as a null operation. MJD fixed this by having Perl skip to the next node in the list rather than trying to grovel over the bytecode.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michael Schwern asked why the <code>Regexp</code> type you get when you do <code>ref qr/foo/</code> wasn&rsquo;t documented, or why it wasn&rsquo;t <code>REGEXP</code> like all the other built-in types. Jarkko agreed it should be <code>REGEXP</code> and Larry (Look, he&rsquo;s back!) suggested making it <code>REGEX</code> instead for pronouncability. Sarathy said he wanted to change it, but there were a couple of points that never got resolved: the name (which we now have a diktat on) and what the class should do. So Schwern suggested a patch to change the name. Sarathy, however, was concerned at the fact that since the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; returned by <code>qr/foo/</code> is actually blessed, one can treat it as an object and create a <code>Regexp.pm</code> to implement methods for this object. (This is exactly what Damian Conway does in his Object Oriented Perl book.) The point of the upper-cased types are unblessed; there&rsquo;s nothing to stop someone writing <code>SCALAR.pm</code> but that would get confusing, because you could no longer tell whether something coming back from <code>ref</code> was blessed or unblessed. This convinced Jarkko not to change the capitalisation of <code>Regexp</code>.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-ithreads-ithreads-span"><span id="iThreads">iThreads</span></h3>

<p>Artur Bergman reported that he&rsquo;d started work on a module which will hopefully one day replace <code>Thread.pm</code>. Instead of the old-style &ldquo;5.005&rdquo; threading, it uses the new interpreter threads. These are called iThreads, come in a range of exciting colours and are hideously overpriced. They&rsquo;re the trickery used to emulate <code>fork</code> on Windows - instead of forking, all you do is clone the interpreter to form a &ldquo;pseudo-process&rdquo;.</p>

<p>However, until now there hasn&rsquo;t been a way to control iThreads from Perl space; it all has to be done from C. Artur&rsquo;s not finished yet, but I hear that he&rsquo;s got quite a lot of the fundamentals working.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-b-bumblings-b-bumblings-span"><span id="B_Bumblings">B Bumblings</span></h3>

<p>Robin produced a rather amazing patch which adds support for pragmata in <code>B::Deparse</code>. He also added something to parenthesis arguments to currently-undefined subroutines; that is:</p>

<pre><code>    foo 23
    sub foo { }
</code></pre>

<p>needs parenthesis. Then he fixed UTF8 literal strings, and noticed a problem with regular expressions and large codepoints. David Dyck fixed the deparsing of <code>split &quot; &quot;</code> which was previously saying <code>split /\s+/</code>. Robin also got the deparser recognising special constants like <code>$^W</code>, and recognising the difference between lexical and global variables. Oh, and <code>BEGIN/INIT/END</code> blocks, and all sorts of other little features.</p>

<p>Michael Schwern has also been messing about with <code>B</code>, and found some mis-documentation in <code>B::walksymtable</code>, which he fixed up, as well as a bug in what Robin had been playing with. Robert replied with a truly wonderful explanation of <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-04/msg01253.html">how pragmata can be detected</a>.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-various-various-span"><span id="Various">Various</span></h3>

<p>Benjamin Franz announced Yet Another Mailing List, a working group to come up with a coherent strategy for coming up with a &ldquo;named parameters&rdquo; module. If that appeals to you, send mail with a body of <code>subscribe argument-shop</code> to <code>majordomo@nihongo.org</code>.</p>

<p>Elaine Ashton put in a couple of patches to the FAQ, as well as adding &ldquo;mailing list&rdquo; and &ldquo;license&rdquo; sections to the stub documentation produced by <code>h2xs</code>. These weren&rsquo;t huge, but I mention them because Elaine&rsquo;s one of those unsung heros, and people tend to forget the work she does for us in terms of behind the scenes things, such as tidying up the FAQ, perl.org stuff, the &ldquo;CPAN search engine&rdquo; and the wonderful <a href="http://lists.perl.org/">Perl mailing lists lists</a>.</p>

<p>Tom Roche came up with a suggestion to change Perl&rsquo;s version searching behaviour to allow different versions of a module to be installed. There were various explanations given for why this wouldn&rsquo;t work, (since Perl must load a module before recognising its version) and two neat alternative solutions: Richard Soderberg suggested a coderef in <code>@INC</code> and MJD suggested simply putting the version number in the module&rsquo;s file name. In fact, why not have a directory per module, so you have <code>use Foo::Bar::1.10</code>? But I digress&hellip;</p>

<p>Calle Dybedhal asked why we have a file called <code>patchlevel.h</code>, since ImageMagick has one too, and that was screwing up Perl. Larry replied, saying that we had it first.</p>

<p>Until next week I remain, your humble and obedient servant,</p>
