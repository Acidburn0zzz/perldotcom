<p>So you use Perl, and you probably know that it was brought to you by &ldquo;Larry Wall and a cast of thousands&rdquo;. But do you know these people that make up the Perl development team? Every month, we&rsquo;re going to be featuring an interview with a Perl Porter so you can get to know the people behind Perl. This time, Simon Cozens, www.perl.com editor, talks to Nathan Torkington, a long-time Perl developer and a mainstay of the Perl community.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you and what do you do?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m Nathan Torkington. My day job is a book editor for O&rsquo;Reilly and Associates. Before that I was a trainer, working for Tom Christiansen. Perl folks might know me as co-author (with Tom) of The Perl Cookbook, the schedule planner for The Perl Conference (and this year the Open Source Convention), or as the project manager for perl6.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-programming-perl">How long have you been programming Perl?</h3>

<p>Since the early 90s. I forget exactly when I first started programming in Perl. I think it was toward the end of 1992, when I was working with gopher and the early web. Back in those days we didn&rsquo;t talk about &ldquo;the web&rdquo;, we were just trying to set up a Campus-Wide Information Service. I took the plunge and pushed for (and got) the www as the basis for the CWIS, even though Gopher was more mature and had more stuff on it.</p>

<p>Using the CERN httpd and line mode browser, I worked on interfacing a bunch of data sources to the web. Perl was, of course, the language for that. I did work with SGML, comma separated files, and even used oraperl once or twice (I feared and loathed Oracle, though, it was only once or twice!).</p>

<p>So I got into Perl with the web. When I moved to the US in 1996, I worked as a systems administrator at an ISP. There I rapidly became the Perl guy, writing admin scripts and CGI applications for in-house and customers. When I left in 1998, we were using mod_perl and had a bunch of good Perl programmers.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-anything-did-you-program-before-learning-perl">What, if anything, did you program before learning Perl?</h3>

<p>I first learned Commodore BASIC when I was 8 or 9, then 6502 assembler. I learned Pascal on the IBM PC, as well as C and 8086 assembler. At university they taught us Pascal again, then Modula-2 or Modula-3 (whichever it was, it was with a MetroWerks Mac IDE that kept crashing). Through Pascal, and their eventual reteaching of C, I got the hang of pointers (yes, I wasn&rsquo;t a very GOOD assembly language programmer if it took me about six years to learn pointers and realize why my programs would sometimes die).</p>

<h3 id="what-got-you-into-perl">What got you into Perl?</h3>

<p>The web. After I&rsquo;d written a few programs, I really enjoyed it. The language was fun, and the culture good. It was so thrilling to be able to do something in 5 minutes and 20 lines that used to take two days in C. In some ways I miss that fun&ndash;over the years (and especially writing the Cookbook) I&rsquo;ve learned so much about how to do things in Perl that there&rsquo;s not much discovery of fun new features any more. And I&rsquo;m so used to being able to do things in 5 minutes and 20 lines that I&rsquo;m no longer delighted when I can do so&ndash;I <strong>expect</strong> it!</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-still-prefer-perl">Why do you still prefer Perl?</h3>

<p>It can do everything I want to do, and I already know it. If I wasn&rsquo;t a Perl programmer, I&rsquo;d probably be happy in Ruby or Python. But so long as there&rsquo;s Perl, I see no reason to become as familiar with those languages as I am with Perl.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I think everyone should program exclusively in Perl. My friend Jules was the one who learned a lot of languages. He was writing extensions for Microsoft COBOL in 1992, and has done significant projects in C++ and Java. He works at a contracting company where the projects don&rsquo;t always lend themselves to Perl. I&rsquo;m totally cool with that.</p>

<h3 id="what-sort-of-things-do-you-do-with-perl-now-what-was-the-last-perl-program-you-wrote">What sort of things do you do with Perl now? What was the last Perl program you wrote?</h3>

<p>When I became a trainer, I was glad to stop being a full-time programmer. Since then I&rsquo;ve begun to miss using Perl. These days I only write utilities and basic web applications. For instance, the last few projects I&rsquo;ve written have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>A small web-based database system for keeping track of the books I&rsquo;m editing&ndash;author addresses, status, number of chapters to go, etc. That was a CGI program with home-grown templates and a DBM database.</li>
<li>Some small tools to unmangle Framemaker files for the Perl Conference proceedings.</li>
<li>A translation of a Python PDF-generating library to Perl. That&rsquo;s incomplete, because I struck Python code I need to research.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-coaxed-you-into-the-development-side-of-perl">What coaxed you into the development side of Perl?</h3>

<p>The feeling that I should know more about it. In some ways it&rsquo;s probably insecurity&ndash;&ldquo;sure, you know all stuff about the Perl language, but can you tell an SV from an SUV?&rdquo; So I started probing at the fringes of the internals.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-remember-your-first-patch">Do you remember your first patch?</h3>

<p>My first (and probably only ;-) real patch was to comment <code>toke.c</code>, the tokenizer. The code that works out where double-quoted strings and regular expressions end was a lot of fun (and by fun I mean &ldquo;pain&rdquo;) to work out. Although I know a lot of low level (data structures) and high level principles about how the internals work (compile to op tree, interpret), I&rsquo;m still missing a lot of the middle ground that would actually enable me to <strong>fix</strong> bugs.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-usually-do-for-perl-development-now">What do you usually do for Perl development now?</h3>

<p>Nothing, I&rsquo;m a manager :-) I&rsquo;m slowly herding Larry towards finishing the Apocalypses, and from that will spring perl 6. For Perl 5 I&rsquo;m more behind the scenes. I&rsquo;m often asked to nag or poke or otherwise get results from others.</p>

<h3 id="talking-of-perl-6-how-do-you-think-the-project-s-going-so-far">Talking of Perl 6, how do you think the project&rsquo;s going so far?</h3>

<p>Last year I&rsquo;d naively hoped that we&rsquo;d have an alpha for TPC, but that&rsquo;s not happening. Instead, we have the start of Larry&rsquo;s pronouncements. And while perl6 has been slower than we expected, perl5 has received a shot in the arm! Jarkko&rsquo;s patching like a madman, there are new internals hackers springing up, and there are cool new modules (<code>SOAP::Lite</code>, <code>Inline</code>, <code>Attributes::*</code>, <code>Filter::Simple</code>, etc.) coming out every week.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that we&rsquo;re all blocked on Larry, though. We know the large shape (and a lot of the details) of how the internals will work. Dan&rsquo;s specing those out in <a href="http://dev.perl.org/pdd/">Perl Design Documents</a>, and your fair self has implemented a few of the projected perl6 syntactic features with patches to Perl 5. (You can download the <a href="http://simon-cozens.org/hacks/perl6.tar.gz">Perl 6 emulator</a> and play about with Perl 6.) If you haven&rsquo;t already seen Marcel Grunauer&rsquo;s page of Perl6-like modules, <a href="http://www.codewerk.com/perl6/">check it out!</a></p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of activity in perl6 as well as in perl5.</p>

<h3 id="finally-what-s-the-best-thing-about-perl-and-what-s-the-worst-thing-about-it">Finally, what&rsquo;s the best thing about Perl, and what&rsquo;s the worst thing about it?</h3>

<p>Best thing? The way that it values programmer fun as much as anything else. Perl delights in being a language that is supposed to be fun. Having seen many people burn out, fun is a good thing. Fun is what keeps you sane, keeps you interested, keeps you going.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the worst thing? Probably the internals. They&rsquo;re ugly and resemble nothing so much as a Lovecraftian horror. We really want perl6 to have much nicer innards. Ideally it&rsquo;ll be almost as simple to program in perl6 innards as it is to program in perl6 itself. That&rsquo;s one of the main reasons to have perl6&ndash;a cleaner core.</p>
