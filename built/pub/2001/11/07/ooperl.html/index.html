<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started learning to play the game of Go. Go and Perl have many things in common &ndash; the basic stuff of which they are made, the rules of the game, are relatively simple, and hide an amazing complexity of possibilities beneath the surface. But I think the most interesting thing I&rsquo;ve found that Go and Perl have in common is that there are various different stages in your development as you learn either one. It&rsquo;s almost as if there are several different plateaus of experience, and you have to climb up a huge hill before getting onto the next plateau.</p>

<p>For instance, a Go player can play very simply and acquit himself quite decently, but to stop being a beginner and really get into the game, he has to learn how to attack and defend economically. Then, to move on to the next stage, he has to master fighting a repetitive sequence called a &ldquo;ko.&rdquo; As I progress, I expect there to be other difficult strategies I need to master before I can become a better player.</p>

<p>Perl, too, is not without its plateaus of knowledge, and in my experience, the one that really separates the beginner from the intermediate programmer is an understanding of object-oriented (OO) programming. Once you&rsquo;ve understood how to use OO Perl, the door is opened to a huge range of interesting and useful CPAN modules, new programming techniques, and mastery of the upper plateaus of Perl programming.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-is-it">So what is it?</h3>

<p>Object-oriented programming is one of those buzzwordy manager-speak phrases, but unlike most of them, it actually means something. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some perfectly ordinary procedural Perl code, bread and butter programming to most beginning programmers:</p>

<pre><code>my $request = accept_request($client);
my $answer = process_request($request);
answer_request($client, $answer);
$new_request = redirect_request($client, $request, $new_url);
</code></pre>

<p>The example here is of something like a Web server: we receive a request from a client, process it in some way to obtain an answer, and send the answer to the client. Additionally, we can also redirect the request to a different URL.</p>

<p>The same code, written in an object-oriented style, would look a little different:</p>

<pre><code>my $request = $client-&gt;accept();
$request-&gt;process();
$client-&gt;answer($request);
$new_request = $request-&gt;redirect($new_url);
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on here? What are these funny arrows? The thing to remember about object-oriented programming is that we&rsquo;re no longer passing the data around to subroutines, to have subroutines do things for us &ndash; now, we&rsquo;re telling the data to do things for itself. You can think of the arrows, (<code>-&gt;</code>, formally the &ldquo;method call operator&rdquo;) as instructions to the data. In the first line, we&rsquo;re telling the data that represents the client to accept a request and pass us something back.</p>

<p>What is this &ldquo;data that represents the client,&rdquo; and what does it pass back? Well, if this is object-oriented programming, we can probably guess the answer: they&rsquo;re both objects. They look like ordinary Perl scalars, right? Well, that&rsquo;s just because objects really are like ordinary Perl scalars.</p>

<p>The only difference between <code>$client</code> and <code>$request</code> in each example is that in the object-oriented version, the scalars happen to know where to find some subroutines that they can call. (In OO speak, we call them &ldquo;methods&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;subroutines.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>This is why we don&rsquo;t have to say <code>process_request</code> in the OO case: if we&rsquo;re calling the <code>process</code> method on something that knows it&rsquo;s a request, it knows that it&rsquo;s processing a request. Simple, eh? In OO speak, we say that the <code>$request</code> object is in the Request &ldquo;class&rdquo; &ndash; a class is the &ldquo;type of thing&rdquo; that the object is, and classes are how objects locate their methods. Hence, <code>$request-&gt;redirect</code> and <code>$mail-&gt;redirect</code> will call completely different methods if <code>$request</code> and <code>$mail</code> are in different classes; what it means to redirect a Request object is very different to redirecting a Mail object.</p>

<p>You might wonder what&rsquo;s actually going on when we call a method. Since we know that methods are just the OO form of subroutines, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find that methods in Perl really are just subroutines. What about classes? Well, the purpose of a class is to distinguish one set of methods from another. And what&rsquo;s a natural way to distinguish one set of subroutines from another in Perl? You guessed it &ndash; in Perl, classes are just packages. So if we&rsquo;ve got an object called <code>$request</code> in the <code>Request</code> class and we call the redirect method, this is what actually happens:</p>

<pre><code># $request-&gt;redirect($new_url)

Request::redirect($request, $new_url)
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s right &ndash; we just call the <code>redirect</code> subroutine in the appropriate package, and pass in the object along with any other parameters. Why do we pass in the object? So that <code>redirect</code> knows what object it&rsquo;s working on.</p>

<p>At a very basic level, this is all OO Perl is &ndash; it&rsquo;s another syntax for writing subroutine calls so that it looks like you&rsquo;re performing actions on some data. At that, for most users of OO Perl modules, is as much as you need to know.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-a-win">Why is it a win?</h3>

<p>So if that&rsquo;s all it is, why does everyone think that OO Perl is the best thing since sliced bread? You&rsquo;ll certainly find that a whole host of interesting and useful modules out there depend on OO techniques. To understand what everyone sees in it, let&rsquo;s go back to procedural code for a moment. Here&rsquo;s something that extracts the sender and subject of a mail message:</p>

<pre><code>sub mail_subject {
    my $mail = shift;
    my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
    for (@lines) {
        return $1 if /^Subject: (.*)/;
        return if /^$/; # Blank line ends headers
    }
}
sub mail_sender {
    my $mail = shift;
    my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
    for (@lines) {
        return $1 if /^From: (.*)/;
        return if /^$/;
    }
}

my $subject = mail_subject($mail);
my $from    = mail_sender($mail);
</code></pre>

<p>All well and good, but notice that we have to run through the whole mail each time we want to get new information about it. Now, it&rsquo;s true we could replace the body of these two subroutines with quite a complicated regular expression, but that&rsquo;s not the point: we&rsquo;re still doing more work than we ought to.</p>

<p>For our equivalent OO example, let&rsquo;s use the CPAN module <code>Mail::Header</code>. This takes a reference to an array of lines, and spits out a mail header object to which we can then do things.</p>

<pre><code>my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
my $header = Mail::Header-&gt;new(\@lines);

my $subject = $header-&gt;get(&quot;subject&quot;);
my $from    = $header-&gt;get(&quot;from&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>Not only are we now looking at the problem from a perspective of &ldquo;doing things to the header&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re also giving the module an opportunity to make this more efficient. How come?</p>

<p>One of the main benefits of CPAN modules is that they give us a set of functions we can call, and we don&rsquo;t have to care how they&rsquo;re implemented. OO programming calls this &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; - the implementation is abstracted from the user&rsquo;s perspective. Similarly, we don&rsquo;t have to care what <code>$mail_obj</code> really is. It could just be our reference to an array of lines, but on the other hand, <code>Mail::Header</code> can do clever things with it.</p>

<p>In reality, <code>$header</code> is a hash reference under the hood. Again, we don&rsquo;t need to care whether or not it&rsquo;s a hash reference or an array reference or something altogether different, but as it&rsquo;s a hash reference, this allows the constructor, <code>new</code> (a constructor is just a method that creates a new object) to do all the pre-processing on our array of lines once and for all, and then store the subject, sender, and all sorts of other fields into some hash keys. All that <code>get</code> does, essentially, is retrieve the appropriate value from the hash. This is obviously vastly more efficient than running through the whole message each time.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what an object really is: it&rsquo;s something that the module can rearrange and use any representation of your data that it likes so that it&rsquo;s most efficient to operate on in the future. You, as an end user, get the benefits of a smart implementation (assuming, of course, that the person who wrote the module is smart&hellip;) and you don&rsquo;t need to care about, or even actually see, see what&rsquo;s going on underneath.</p>

<h3 id="using-it">Using it</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a simple use of OO techniques by using <code>Mail::Header</code>. Let&rsquo;s now look at a slightly more involved program, to solidify our knowledge. This is a very simple system information server for a Unix machine. (Don&rsquo;t be put off &ndash; these programs will work on non-Unix systems as well.) Unix has a client/server protocol called &ldquo;finger,&rdquo; by which you can contact a server and ask for information about its users. I run &ldquo;finger&rdquo; on my username at a local machine, and get:</p>

<pre><code>% finger simon
Login name: simon       (messages off)  In real life: Simon Cozens

Directory: /v0/xzdg/simon               Shell: /usr/local/bin/bash

On since Nov  6 12:28:08
   on pts/197 from riot-act.somewhere
Project: Hacking Perl for Sugalski
Plan:

Insert amusing anecdote here.
</code></pre>

<p>What we&rsquo;re going to do is write our own finger client and a server which dishes out information about the current system, and we&rsquo;re going to do this using the object-oriented <code>IO::Socket</code> module. Of course, we could do this completely procedurally, using <code>Socket.pm</code>, but it&rsquo;s actually comparatively much easier to do it this way.</p>

<p>First, the client. The finger protocol, as much as we need to care about it, is really simple. The client connects and sends a line of text &ndash; generally, a username. The server sends back some text, and then closes the connection.</p>

<p>By using <code>IO::Socket</code> to manage the connection, we can come up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use IO::Socket::INET;

my ($host, $username) = @ARGV;

my $socket = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(
                        PeerAddr =&gt; $host,
                        PeerPort =&gt; &quot;finger&quot;
                      ) or die $!;

$socket-&gt;print($username.&quot;\n&quot;);

while ($_ = $socket-&gt;getline) {
    print;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty straightforward: the <code>IO::Socket::INET</code> constructor <code>new</code> gives us an object representing the connection to peer address <code>$host</code> on port <code>finger</code>. We can then call the <code>print</code> and <code>getline</code> methods to send and receive data from the connection. Compare this with the non-OO equivalent, and you may realize why people prefer dealing with objects:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Socket;
my ($remote,$port, $iaddr, $paddr, $proto, $user);

($remote, $user) = @ARGV; 

$port    = getservbyname('finger', 'tcp')   || die &quot;no port&quot;;
$iaddr   = inet_aton($remote)               || die &quot;no host: $remote&quot;;
$paddr   = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);

$proto   = getprotobyname('tcp');
socket(SOCK, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)  || die &quot;socket: $!&quot;;
connect(SOCK, $paddr)                       || die &quot;connect: $!&quot;;
print SOCK &quot;$user\n&quot;;
while (&lt;SOCK&gt;)) {
   print;
}

close (SOCK)            || die &quot;close: $!&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to turn to the server. We&rsquo;ll also use another OO module, <code>Net::hostent</code>, which allows us to treat the result of <code>gethostbyaddr</code> as an object, rather than as a list of values. This means we don&rsquo;t have to worry about remembering which element of the list means what we want.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use IO::Socket;
use Net::hostent;

my $server = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new( Proto     =&gt; 'tcp',
                                    LocalPort =&gt; 'finger',
                                    Listen    =&gt; SOMAXCONN,
                                    Reuse     =&gt; 1);
die &quot;can't setup server&quot; unless $server;

while ($client = $server-&gt;accept()) {
  $client-&gt;autoflush(1);
  $hostinfo = gethostbyaddr($client-&gt;peeraddr);
  printf &quot;[Connect from %s]\n&quot;, $hostinfo-&gt;name || $client-&gt;peerhost;
  my $command = client-&gt;getline();
  if    ($command =~ /^uptime/) { $client-&gt;print(`uptime`); }
  elsif ($command =~ /^date/)   { $client-&gt;print(scalar localtime, &quot;\n&quot;); }
  else  { $client-&gt;print(&quot;Unknown command\n&quot;);
  $client-&gt;close;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is chock-full of OO Perl goodness &ndash; a method call on nearly every line. We start in a very similar way to how we wrote the client: using <code>IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new</code> as a constructor. Did you notice anything strange about this? <code>IO::Socket::INET</code> is a package name, which means it must be a class, rather than an object. But we can still call methods on classes (they&rsquo;re generally called &ldquo;class methods,&rdquo; for obvious reasons) and this is how most objects actually get instantiated: the class provides a method called <code>new</code> that produces an object for us to manipulate.</p>

<p>The big <code>while</code> loop calls the <code>accept</code> method that waits until a client connects and, when one does, returns another <code>IO::Socket::INET</code> object representing the connection to the client. We can call the client&rsquo;s <code>autoflush</code> method, which is the equivalent to setting <code>$|</code> for its handle; the <code>peeraddr</code> method returns the address of the client, which we can feed to <code>gethostbyaddr</code>.</p>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, this isn&rsquo;t the usual Perl <code>gethostbyadd</code>, but one provided by <code>Net::Hostent</code>, and it returns yet another object! We use the <code>name</code> method from this object, which represents information about a given host, to find the host&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>The rest isn&rsquo;t anything new. If you think back to our client, it sent a line and awaited a response &ndash; so our server has to read a line, and send a response. You get bonus points for adding more possible responses to our server.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So there we are. We&rsquo;ve seen a couple of examples of using object-oriented modules. It wasn&rsquo;t that bad, was it? Hopefully now you&rsquo;ll be well-enough equipped to be able to start using some of the many OO modules on CPAN for yourself.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you feel you need a little more in-depth coverage of OO Perl, you could take a look at the &ldquo;perlboot,&rdquo; &ldquo;perltoot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;perltootc&rdquo; pages in the Perl documentation. <em>The Perl Cookbook</em>, an invaluable book for any serious Perl programmer, has a very comprehensive and easy to follow treatment of OO techniques. Finally, the most in-depth treatment of all can be found in Damian Conway&rsquo;s &ldquo;Object-Oriented Perl&rdquo;, which will see you through from a complete beginner way up to Perl 4 or 5 dan&hellip;</p>
