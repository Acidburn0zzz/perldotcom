<h3 id="span-id-some-basic-concepts-some-basic-concepts-span"><span id="some_basic_concepts">Some Basic Concepts</span></h3>

<p>In order to understand what you might want to do with dates and times, it&rsquo;s good to have a handle on some basic concepts. Here are some terms that I&rsquo;ll be using in this article:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><span id="item_datetime">datetime</span></strong></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_utc">UTC (also GMT and Zulu)</span></strong>
UTC stands for &ldquo;Coordinated Universal Time&rdquo;. It is an international standard which is kept using atomic clocks, and is kept to within 0.9 seconds of the rotation of the earth on its axis in order to work well with traditional standards of time-keeping. UTC time is measured at the prime meridian (O degrees longitude).</p>

<p>Time zones around the world are specified as an offset from UTC. The widely used term GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) refers to a time zone that is equivalent to UTC. In other words, it has no offset.</p>

<p>The US military has a set of terms used for time zones around the world based on the alphabet (A-Z). In this system UTC is Z, sometimes called &ldquo;Zulu&rdquo;.</p>

<p>UTC is a good standard for the <em>internal</em> representation of dates and times, as it makes comparing datetimes or doing datetime math much easier.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_time_zones_and_daylight_saving_time">Time zones and Daylight Saving Time</span></strong></p>

<p>Time zones, as mentioned above, are defined as an offset from UTC. Most, but <em>not</em> all, time zones are in offsets of whole hours. Adelaide, Australia has an offset of nine and a half hours ahead of UTC, and Nepal has an offset five hours and forty-five minutes ahead of UTC.</p>

<p>Time zones are complicated by the use of Daylight Saving Time, which changes the actual offset of a given location to vary over the course of the year. The eastern US has an offset of -0500 from UTC, five hours behind UTC. This means that 12:00 (noon) UTC becomes 07:00 (AM). However, when Daylight Saving Time is in effect, the offset becomes -0400, four hours behind UTC. Because time zones are determined by governments, use of Daylight Saving Time, and the base offsets, have changed over time, and may change again in the future.</p>

<p>This greatly complicates math when dealing with non-UTC datetimes. If I have a local datetime for the Eastern US of 2002-10-25 14:15:00 and I add six months to that datetime, then I will have crossed a DST change.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that any code that represents time zones as <em>fixed</em> offset will probably start producing errors once date math gets involved.</p>

<p>The definitive source of time zone offsets and rules is the Olson time zone database. It defines zones according to names like &ldquo;America/New_York&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;EST&rdquo;. The latter shorthand is commonly used, but it should probably be avoided because these short names are not unique or definitive. For example, there is an &ldquo;EST&rdquo; at -0500 and +1000.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_local_time">Local time</span></strong></p>

<p>The local time is UTC plus the local time zone offset. While UTC is great for internal use, most people want to see datetimes in terms of <em>their</em> location. In a sense, local time is the <em>display</em> format, while UTC is the <em>storage</em> format.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_the_epoch">The epoch</span></strong></p>

<p>Epoch is a generic term referring to the &ldquo;start&rdquo; of any particular system. For example, the Gregorian calendar&rsquo;s epoch is January 1, 1 CE.</p>

<p>The epoch system, as used most operating systems, represents a datetime as the number of seconds after a specific date and time. For Unix systems, the epoch began on January 1, 1970 at midnight GMT (UTC). Other systems have different epochs. Because of this, you cannot assume that an epoch time of 2,003,131 means the same thing from system to system, because different systems have a different &ldquo;second 0&rdquo;. Storing a datetime as its epoch is not portable.</p>

<p>Even worse, on most current systems, epochs are represented by a 32 bit signed integer, which only lets you represent datetimes with a range of about 136 years. On most UNIX systems currently in use, this means that the latest date you can represent right now is sometime in the year 2038, and the earliest is around 1902. This doesn&rsquo;t work very well if you&rsquo;re trying to represent the birth date of your great-great-grandmother.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is I would strongly recommend <em>not</em> using epochs except when you have no other choice. Of course, you&rsquo;ll often have no choice, so it&rsquo;s important to know how this system works.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_the_gregorian_calendar">The Gregorian Calendar</span></strong></p>

<p>There have been many different calendar systems in use throughout history. The Gregorian calendar is the current generally agreed upon international standard for representing dates, and is what you are using when you say &ldquo;August 8, 1999&rdquo;. Other calendars that are still in use include the Hebrew calendar, the Islamic calendar, and the Chinese calendar.</p>

<p>Even though the Gregorian calendar wasn&rsquo;t created until 1582, and it wasn&rsquo;t adopted world wide until this century, we can still extrapolate backwards in time using the Gregorian calendar.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="span-id-what-needs-doing-with-dates-and-times-what-needs-doing-with-dates-and-times-span"><span id="what_needs_doing_with_dates_and_times">What Needs Doing with Dates and Times?</span></h3>

<p>There are a lot of things you can do with dates and times, and different modules/distributions provide different types of functionality. Broadly speaking, we can consider the following areas of functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><span id="item_parsing%2fformatting">Parsing/Formatting</span></strong></p>

<p>There are more datetime formats in use in the computing world than you can shake a stick at. You&rsquo;ll often have to parse a datetime in one format in order to turn it into something you can work with internally, like a bunch of integers or an epoch time.</p>

<p>On the flip side, you&rsquo;ll often have to take some standard representation, like an epoch, and convert it to some other format.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_basic_representation">Basic representation</span></strong></p>

<p>A nice datetime object can be quite handy. These range from lightweight wrappers around Perl&rsquo;s <a href="#item_localtime"><code>localtime()</code></a> to objects that try to provide methods for all possible datetime operations.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_math_and_calculations">Math and calculations</span></strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll often want to answer questions like &ldquo;what day is seven days after today&rdquo; or &ldquo;how much time is there between now and midnight?&rdquo; This is closely related to the task of figuring out the date Easter falls on in a given year, or what day of the week Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday falls on.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are plenty of other things we can do with datetimes, but these are largely elaborations of the above areas of functionality.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-perl-s-builtin-date-time-functionality-perl-s-built-in-date-time-functionality-span"><span id="perl's_builtin_date/time_functionality">Perl&rsquo;s Built-in Date/Time Functionality</span></h3>

<p>Perl has some built-in functionality for handling dates and times. This functionality includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><span id="item_time"><code>time()</code></span></strong></p>

<p>A function that returns the current epoch time.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_localtime"><code>localtime()</code> and <code>gmtime()</code></span></strong></p>

<p>These functions convert an epoch time into a set of components representing the local time. They both return arrays containing things like the hour, minute, month, etc., though some of the values returned are awkward to use. For example, the year is the actual year minus 1900.</p>

<p>The <a href="#item_localtime"><code>localtime()</code></a> function returns the datetime of your current location, based on your system&rsquo;s time zone setting, while the gmtime function returns the current UTC datetime.</p>

<p>The <code>Time::localtime</code> and <code>Time::gmtime</code> modules provide a thin object layer around <code>gmtime()</code> and <a href="#item_localtime"><code>localtime()</code></a> respectively, so you can do things like <code>print gmtime()-&gt;year</code>. Of course, that <em>still</em> prints the year minus 1900.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_time%3a%3alocal">Time::Local</span></strong></p>

<p>This core module provide functions that translate from the array of components returned by <a href="#item_localtime"><code>localtime()</code></a> or <code>gmtime()</code> back to an epoch time.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_posix%2epm">POSIX.pm</span></strong></p>

<p>The <code>POSIX</code> module included with Perl provides interfaces to several common C library functions for datetimes, such as <code>strftime()</code>. I consider this the last refuge for the desperate, because the <a href="#item_posix%2epm"><code>POSIX.pm</code></a> module is a memory hog, and the C library interface is rather un-Perlish.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="span-id-the-big-stars-the-big-stars-span"><span id="the_big_stars">The Big Stars</span></h3>

<p>These are the modules that have the longest history, and are the most widely used.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><span id="item_timedate_distribution">TimeDate distribution</span></strong></p>

<p>This distribution, maintained and mostly written by Graham Barr, includes three modules. <code>Date::Format</code> module provides a few functions for formatting datetime output, including a <code>strftime()</code> similar to the one in the standard C library. It can work with either epoch times, or the array of components returned by Perl&rsquo;s <a href="#item_localtime"><code>localtime()</code></a> function.</p>

<p><code>Date::Parse</code> parses a limited set of common datetime formats, returning either an epoch time or an array of components.</p>

<p>The distribution also includes a number of language modules which can be used to localize both parsing and formatting.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>Time::Zone</code> provides an interface to time zone offsets, based on short time zone names like &ldquo;EST&rdquo; or &ldquo;GMT&rdquo;. As was mentioned before, these names are not official or standardized, so they are of limited usefulness.</p>

<p>All of these modules are limited by their use of epoch time internally, but they are fairly quick and light weight. For complex datetime problems, these modules probably don&rsquo;t automate enough of the dirty work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_time%3a%3apiece">Time::Piece</span></strong></p>

<p>Written and maintained by Matt Sergeant, this module is based on an interface designed by Larry Wall. It provides a convenient object API for datetimes, though the API is a bit confusing. For example, <code>$time-&gt;mon</code> returns the month number (1-12) while <code>$time-&gt;month</code> returns the abbreviated name of the month.</p>

<p>It also implements basic parsing and formatting via the use of the C-level <code>strptime()</code> and <code>strftime()</code> functions. The included <code>Time::Seconds</code> module allows for basic date math, such as <code>$tomorrow = $time + ONE_DAY</code>.</p>

<p>The implementation is fairly lightweight, but is limited by its use of epoch time as the internal representation. It is certainly useful, but like the TimeDate modules, it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough for more complex uses.</p>

<p>As of this writing, Matt Sergeant has released an experimental version of <a href="#item_time%3a%3apiece"><code>Time::Piece</code></a> based on my <code>DateTime.pm</code> module. This leaves the <a href="#item_time%3a%3apiece"><code>Time::Piece</code></a> API unchanged, but allows it to handle dates that cannot be represented by a given system&rsquo;s epoch.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3amanip">Date::Manip</span></strong></p>

<p>Sullivan Beck&rsquo;s <a href="#item_date%3a%3amanip"><code>Date::Manip</code></a> is really huge, weighing in at about 3,000 lines of code. As might be expected of that much code, there is something for everyone here. It handles parsing, formatting, date math, as well as more esoteric things like recurring datetimes and business day calculations. It should be noted that it&rsquo;s time zone support is pretty much the same that provided by <code>Time::Zone</code>.</p>

<p>This module&rsquo;s most unique feature is its very flexible parser, which is capable of handling things like &ldquo;3 weeks ago Monday&rdquo; or &ldquo;next Sunday&rdquo;. It also provides some parsing for specifying recurrences, like &ldquo;every 3rd Monday in 2003&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Unlike everything else we&rsquo;ve covered so far, this module is not limited to epoch times. It has an entirely functional interface, and in my opinion the API could be cleaner. I dislike the fact that some functions do many different things, with the output depending either on the argument type(s), explicit flags, or both.</p>

<p>But the biggest problem with this module, which is acknowledged by its author, is its size. It uses lots of memory (about 3MB on my system), and is fairly slow to load. The former makes it problematic for mod_perl, and the latter causes problems with CGI scripts. You can find most of its features elsewhere, in slimmer modules, but if size and speed are not an issue, this module almost certainly does everything you want.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3acalc">Date::Calc</span></strong></p>

<p>Steffen Beyer&rsquo;s <a href="#item_date%3a%3acalc"><code>Date::Calc</code></a> distribution is where you go when you need functionality combined with speed. This modules offers much of the functionality provided by <a href="#item_date%3a%3amanip"><code>Date::Manip</code></a>, but the core <a href="#item_date%3a%3acalc"><code>Date::Calc</code></a> module has a much smaller memory footprint than <a href="#item_date%3a%3amanip"><code>Date::Manip</code></a> (about 1MB on my box), and much greater speed. This is because its core implementation is in C.</p>

<p>This module provides functions for calculating all sorts of date-related information, as well some minimal parsing and formatting operations. The interface requires some hand-holding to use, as every function returns one or more elements, never a data structure such as a hash, so you have to constantly deal with passing and receiving arrays of values.</p>

<p>The distribution also includes a class called <code>Date::Calc::Object</code>, which can represent either a datetime <em>or</em> a &ldquo;delta&rdquo;, the difference between two datetimes. This dual nature is odd, since many of the methods applicable to one will not work for the other. The class supports overloading for date math and comparison, so you can do things like <code>$date + [1, 2, 3]</code>, which adds one year, two months, and three days to the given date.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a <code>Date::Calendar</code> object, which can be used to set up a calendar &ldquo;profile&rdquo; defining holidays, work days, and partial work days in a variety of ways. This is quite useful if you need to calculate a day X business days in the future, while taking account of a particular organization&rsquo;s holidays.</p>

<p>None of the modules in this distribution rely on epoch time, though they only support positive-numbered years. Time zone support is extremely minimal, and is done only as offsets, without support for daylight saving rules. Localization for a variety of languages is implemented for parsing and formatting.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="span-id-and-a-cast-of-thousands-and-a-cast-of-thousands-span"><span id="and_a_cast_of_thousands_...">And a Cast of Thousands &hellip;</span></h3>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be Perl if there weren&rsquo;t at least a dozen other modules with overlapping functionality, right? In this case, there&rsquo;s more than two dozen! For sanity&rsquo;s sake, I&rsquo;ve excluded more than a few modules, in particular those that either appeared to be unmaintained, or those without enough comprehensible documentation for me to figure out what the heck they do. In alphabetical order, those remaining are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><span id="item_astro%3a%3asunrise_%2d_ron_hill">Astro::Sunrise - Ron Hill</span></strong></p>

<p>This module provides sunrise and sunset times, given a specific date and place.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_astro%3a%3atime_%2d_chris_phillips">Astro::Time - Chris Phillips</span></strong></p>

<p>Contains a number of functions useful when dealing with datetimes as they are used in astronomy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_class%3a%3adate_%2d_balzs_szab">Class::Date - Balázs Szabó</span></strong></p>

<p>This is basically the <a href="#item_time%3a%3apiece"><code>Time::Piece</code></a> API plus more stuff. It appears to provide complete time zone support based on the Olson database, by way of <a href="#item_posix%2epm"><code>POSIX.pm</code></a>. It is epoch-limited.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3abusiness_%2d_richard_desimine">Date::Business - Richard DeSimine</span></strong></p>

<p>A simple interface for doing date math with business dates. In other words, weekends don&rsquo;t count, and you can define your own holidays. This module is epoch-limited.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3aconvert_%2d_mordechai_abzug">Date::Convert - Mordechai Abzug</span></strong></p>

<p>Converts dates between the Gregorian, Hebrew, and Julian calendars.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3aconvert%3a%3afrench_rev_%2d_jean_forget">Date::Convert::French_Rev - Jean Forget</span></strong></p>

<p>Converts to and from the French Revolutionary calendar.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3aday_%2d_john_von_essen">Date::Day - John Von Essen</span></strong></p>

<p>Tells you the day of the week for a given date.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3adayofweek_%2d_rich_bowen">Date::DayofWeek - Rich Bowen</span></strong></p>

<p>Does exactly the same thing as <code>Date::Day</code> but only for years 1500-2699. On the flip side, it uses a cuter algorithm.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3adecade_%2d_michael_diekmann">Date::Decade - Michael Diekmann</span></strong></p>

<p>Provides three decade calculation functions with an API similar to that of <a href="#item_date%3a%3acalc"><code>Date::Calc</code></a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3adiscordian_%2d_rich_bowen">Date::Discordian - Rich Bowen</span></strong></p>

<p>Converts to and from the Discordian calendar.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3aeaster_%2d_rich_bowen">Date::Easter - Rich Bowen</span></strong></p>

<p>Calculates the date Easter falls on in a given year.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><span id="item_date%3a%3ahandler_%2d_benoit_beausejour">Date::Handler - Benoit Beausejour</span></strong></p>

<p>A date object comparable to <a href="#item_time%3a%3apiece"><code>Time::Piece</code></a>, but with a more consistent interface. It implements localization, a variety of date math operations, and includes an object for representing datetime spans. It provides time zone support based on the native OS implementation, which on some systems means support for the Olson database. It is epoch-limited.</p></li>

<h3 id="span-id-but-wait-there-s-more-but-wait-there-s-more-span"><span id="but_wait,_there's_more!">But Wait, There&rsquo;s More!</span></h3>

<p>Not content to leave well enough alone, I&rsquo;ve recently started a project to fix what I see as the fundamental problem with the state of Perl datetime modules. That fundamental problem is that despite the fact that almost all the possible functionality you could want exists, it is scattered over a large number of incompatible modules.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="#item_date%3a%3acalc"><code>Date::Calc</code></a> provides good functionality for various datetime calculations and date math, but the values it returns are not well suited for being passed to <code>Date::Format</code>. And while <a href="#item_date%3a%3amanip"><code>Date::Manip</code></a> has powerful parsing, the return value from its parsing routine cannot be passed to any other module without further massaging. And so and so on.</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to parse a date with <code>Date::Parse</code> and then calculate the date one week later with <a href="#item_date%3a%3acalc"><code>Date::Calc</code></a>, and then format it with <code>Date::Format</code>, I&rsquo;d have to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>my $time1 = str2time($date_string); # Date::Parse

# Today() from Date::Calc returns
# date information for an epoch time
my ($y1, $m1, $d1) = Today($time);

my ($y2, $m2, $d2) = Add_Delta_Days($y1, $m1, $d1, 7);

my $time2 = Date_to_Time($y2, $m2, $d2);

print strftime('%B %d, %Y', $time2);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I didn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to use the <code>strftime()</code> function for formatting a date. I could have done it with just <a href="#item_date%3a%3acalc"><code>Date::Calc</code></a> as:</p>

<pre><code>print sprintf('%s %02d %04d',
Month_to_Text($m2), $d2, $y2);
</code></pre>

<p>But I want convenience. If I&rsquo;m dealing with many datetimes and I need to parse various inputs, generate different formats, and do lots of calculations, then a convenient and uniform API can go a long way towards code maintainability. The extra glue code needed to make different modules cooperate can quickly obscure the actual intent of the program.</p>

<p>Efforts in the past to herd all the existing module authors towards a common API have failed, so rather than try that again, I decided to just write even more datetime code. As we all know, the best way to put out a fire is to pour copious amounts of gasoline on it. In order to make my project sound cool, I&rsquo;m calling it the &ldquo;Perl DateTime Suite&rdquo;, which sounds much better than &ldquo;more date and time modules&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The goal for this project is to produce a suite of datetime modules that do everything you&rsquo;d ever need related to dates and times. The modules in this suite will cooperate with each other, which means that a module that parses datetimes will return a standard object, and a module for formatting datetimes will accept that standard object.</p>

<p>So far, this project has attracted interest from a number of people, and discussions on the <a href="mailto:datetime@perl.org">datetime@perl.org</a> list have gone well. Recently, I released alpha versions of the core object, <code>DateTime.pm</code>, as well as <code>DateTime::TimeZone</code>, which provides complete time zone support based on the Olson database. There is also an alpha of <code>DateTime::Format::ICal</code> on CPAN, a module for parsing and formatting iCal datetimes and durations. In the future, look for more modules in the suite, all of which will begin with &ldquo;DateTime::&ldquo;.</p>
