<h3 id="span-id-introduction-introduction-span"><span id="introduction">Introduction</span></h3>

<p>This is intended to be a short summary of the major and important threads of discussion on the perl5-porters mailing list this week.</p>

<p>I am trying to add value to the summary by omitting threads that I perceive as uninteresting. For example, you often see threads of this type:</p>

<p><strong>Person A</strong><br />
Here is a problem with Perl when you try to do X. I propose solution S.</p>

<p><strong>Person B</strong><br />
Solution S is unnecessary because you can do Y instead.</p>

<p><strong>Person A</strong><br />
No, that does not work, because of Z.</p>

<p><strong>Person B</strong><br />
Oh, I totally misunderstood what you were doing.</p>

<p><strong>Person C</strong><br />
But solution S will break existing code.</p>

<p><strong>Person A</strong><br />
No, it won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><strong>Person C</strong><br />
Oh, you&rsquo;re right. I thought you meant something else.</p>

<p><strong>Person A</strong><br />
Here is a patch to implement solution S.</p>

<p>I am going to try to omit these blind alleys. I will also try to omit some other types of messages:</p>

<p><strong>Person D</strong><br />
Why are submitting a patch for S when we know it will break old code and anyway you could be doing Y instead?</p>

<p><strong>Person E</strong><br />
Fortran has adopted solution S. Perl is not Fortran; therefore solution S is no good. If you want Fortran, you know where to find it.</p>

<p><strong>Person F</strong><br />
You shut up.</p>

<p><strong>Person G</strong><br />
No, you shut up.</p>

<p><strong>Person H</strong><br />
Your formatting style offends me profoundly. Can&rsquo;t you get a real mailer?</p>

<p><strong>Person I</strong><br />
How can I develop CGI scripts offline on my W98 machine?</p>

<p><strong>Person J</strong><br />
P5P is not a help desk.</p>

<p><strong>Person K</strong><br />
I am writing to report a bug in the <code>localtime</code> function. It returns the wrong month.</p>

<p><strong>Person L</strong><br />
WORK FROM HOME!!!!</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff I omitted is on topic and has real value, but isn&rsquo;t particularly interesting. For example I have omitted a bunch of cases where someone submitted a minor patch that was accepted with no discsusion. I omitted some discussions that did not seem to be of general interest. For example, this week, Brad Appleton and Ilya Zakharevich had an exchange about the pod-formatting features of cperl-mode.</p>

<p>It is hard to keep track of everything, and I may occasionally omit something you think is important, or I might misunderstand some important issue. Your additions and emendations are welcome. Please send any corrections, suggestions, additions, or embellishments to <code>mjd-perl-thisweek-YYYYMM@plover.com</code> where <code>YYYYMM</code> is the current year and month. For a more complete view of perl5-porters, either subscribe to the mailing list or <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/">check the archive</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to include hot links to the relevant messages in the archive, but the archive was down and I could not get the URLs. This will be corrected in a future issue, even if we have to start our own archive.</p>

<p>Sarathy also said that he was moving into beta mode for the upcoming version 5.6.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-charclasses-unicode-character-classes-span"><span id="charclasses">Unicode Character Classes</span></h3>

<p>Jarkko realized that since Perl was moving into beta mode for 5.6, this was his last chance to propose a new feature. He wants Perl regexes to support the `equivalence class&rsquo; feature of POSIX 1003.2. What this means is that certain characters in the character set may be deemed `equivalent&rsquo;, and the notation <code>[=c=]</code> denotes a character class containing all the characters equivalent to <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>How do you decide which characters are considered `equivalent&rsquo;? Unicode provides a definition that allows you to understand a character like <code>é</code>; as an <code>e</code> with an acute accent; we could have Perl understand this to be equivalent to a plain <code>e</code>. Then the notation <code>[=e=]</code> would match any of <code>e</code>, <code>é</code>, <code>è</code>, <code>ë</code>, or <code>ê</code>. This might be useful.</p>

<p>Jarkko also wants people to be able to define their own equivalence relations, and he wants the <code>m//</code> and <code>s///</code> operators to support a new option, analogous to <code>/i</code>, which would say to ignore all diacritical marks, again using the Unicode tables to decide what a diacritical mark is.</p>

<p>People brought up a number of potential problems; for example, in Danish, the character <code>å</code> (U00E5) is considered to be an entirely different letter from <code>a</code> and not equivalent to it at all. But according to Unicode, <code>å</code> is indeed an <code>a</code> with a diacritical mark. (Jarkko: ``Ha! I am just expecting some Danes &hellip; to jump up here and wave frantically their hands&hellip; &ldquo; )</p>

<p>Discussion continues; I will deliver an update next week if there is anything to report. By the way, the <a href="http://charts.unicode.org/">Unicode code charts</a> are great browsing. <a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/">The databases that say which characters are composed from which others</a> are interesting too.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-bundling-module-bundling-and-the-proposed-import-pragma-span"><span id="bundling">Module Bundling and the proposed import pragma</span></h3>

<p>Tim Bunce forwarded a message that Michael King had sent to the <code>modules@perl.com</code> mailing list. Michael had written a new module, which he named <code>import</code>. The idea of <code>import</code> is this: Suppose you have a bunch of modules that are for internal use at your company only. You are worried about namespace collisions with CPAN modules. You can name your internal-use modules with names that all begin with <code>com::yourcompany</code> and then use</p>

<pre><code> use import 'com::yourcompany';
</code></pre>

<p>This does two things. First, it locates <em>all</em> modules in the <code>com::yourcompany</code> space on the local machine and imports them all. But second, it imports each <code>com::yourcompany::Foo</code> module with the <code>com::yourcompany</code> part stripped off. This means that if, for example, you have a <code>com::yourcompany::Template</code> module, you can now call <code>Template-&gt;new()</code> instead of <code>com::yourcompany::Template-&gt;new()</code>.</p>

<p>Michael says that this is like the <code>import</code> keyword in Java.</p>

<p>This touched off a number of interesting discussions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Andreas König suggested that Perl should support a</p>

<pre><code> package &quot;www.foo.org&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>directive which would be equivalent to <code>package       org::foo::www;</code>. But Chip Salzenberg said that this was usually understood to have been a bad idea, because organizations often change URLs for various reasons. For example, <code>foo.com</code> and <code>bar.com</code> might merge to become <code>foobar.com</code>. Says Chip: <em>One of the best things about CPAN is that it is the de facto root namespace for all shared Perl modules. Let&rsquo;s not throw that away!</em></p></li>

<li><p>This led to a general discussion about how entire module namespaces might be reserved.</p>

<p>Damian Conway pointed out that we could simply establish the convention that if you have a PAUSE id, that module space is reserved for you. For example, Damian&rsquo;s PAUSE id is DCONWAY; under this convention, all modules beginning with <code>DCONWAY::*</code> would belong to him.</p>

<p>Problems with this scheme: Uri Guttman would now own the <code>URI::*</code> space, including the <code>URI::URL</code> module. Nick Ing-Simmons&rsquo;s PAUSE id is <code>NI-S</code>, which is not a valid package identifier.</p></li>

<li><p>John Redford suggested a module that lets you bundle many modules into one. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then you could write a bundling module, like this:</p>

<pre><code>                package MyCompany::CGIBundle;
                use MyCompany::CGI::BobsCode::Foo;
                use MyCompany::CGI::Test::Bar;
                use MyCompany::CGI::BobsBetterCode::Foo2;
                ....
                use NameSpace::Transitive;
</code></pre>

<p>And then people could just write:</p>

<pre><code>                use MyCompany::CGIBundle;
</code></pre>

<p>to get all the symbols that were exported into <code>MyCompany::CGIBundle</code> re-exported into their own namespace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had written a module something like this back in February, so I decided that put it on CPAN. It is now available as ModuleBundle. Nick Ing-Simmons also pointed out that his <code>Tk::widgets</code> module does something similar: <code>use TK::widgets qw(Text       Entry Canvas)</code> is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code> use Tk::Text ();
 use Tk::Entry ();
 use Tk::Canvas();
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>A couple of people wanted the two functions of this module to be separated. They liked the idea of being able to alias namespaces, so that the objects in <code>com::yourcompany::Template</code> could be referred to as if they were in <code>Template</code>, but they were worried about the other function, which is to locate and import a whole lot of stuff indiscriminately. There was some discussion of a namespace aliasing pragma, or of adding this functionality to the existing <code>Alias</code> module.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There were also a number of uninteresting discussions: Someone wanted to know what would happen if you said <code>use import 'CGI'</code>. Michael&rsquo;s answer to that was that that was not what <code>import</code> was for and that whoever did that would get the bizarre behavior that they deserved. That did not stop a lot of people from making a big fuss about it, however. One person even said ``If you want that functionality, why don&rsquo;t you write a module to do that?&rdquo; apparently having forgotten that the way the discussion started was that Michael had written a module to do that, notified the modules list, and then Tim Bunce forwarded his note to P5P.</p>

<p>It appears that Michael is now pursuing a name in the <code>Import</code> namespace, and may make some changes to the module&rsquo;s calling interface to better seprate the two functions of his module.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-fields-use-fields-allows-overlapping-member-names-span"><span id="fields">use fields allows overlapping member names</span></h3>

<p>Tuomas Lukka discovered a gotcha in <code>field.pm</code>. The gotcha is this: Suppose you have a base and a derived class, and both contain a field with the same name, say <code>f</code>. Suppose the method <code>m</code> is defined in the base class and inherited by the derived class. Now create an object of the derived class, and call <code>m</code> on the object. Suppose <code>m</code> contains code to modify field <code>f</code>. There are two fields named <code>f</code>. Which one will be modified?</p>

<p>You would expect that, because <code>m</code> is defined in the base class, it should modify the base class&rsquo;s <code>f</code>. And so it does, if <code>m</code> is written correctly:</p>

<pre><code> package Base;

 sub m {
   my Base $self = shift;
   $self-&gt;{f} = 'newvalue';   # Modifies base class field f
 }
</code></pre>

<p>But if you accidentally write <code>my $self</code> instead of <code>my Base $self</code>, it modifies the wrong member:</p>

<pre><code> package Base;

 sub m {
   my $self = shift;
   $self-&gt;{f} = 'newvalue';   # Modifies DERIVED class field f
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Tuomas points out that the declaration and use of <code>$self</code> might be very far apart, and that a mistake in a far-away declaration could introduce a bug in the program that was difficult to find. Worse, suppose the object was stored inside some other object, so that instead of <code>$self-&gt;{f}</code> you had <code>$object-&gt;{subobject}-&gt;{f}</code>; in this case no declaration at all applies and you get the same problem.</p>

<p>Tuomas&rsquo; solution is to simply forbid conflicting field names. <code>fields.pm</code> and <code>base.pm</code> will detect this and throw a fatal exception if they detect that a derived class is using a member with the same name as one of its parent classes.</p>

<p>Tuomas&rsquo;s rationale: It is very dangerous at present, and is `action at a distance&rsquo;, which means that two apparently unrelated declarations far away, even in entirely different files, might drastially alter the behavior of a subroutine in a third location. The prohibition can be lifted later if a way is found to make it safer, and nobody appears to be using it now. (Someone thought they were, but realized they were mistaken.)</p>

<p>Sarathy appeared to be persuaded that the situation required at least a warning. Tuomas is pushing for a fatal compile-time error.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-prepare-prepare-functions-and-my-class-foo-span-declarations"><span id="prepare">PREPARE functions and my Class $foo</span> declarations</h3>

<p>Ilya had submitted a patch which would have made <code>my Class $foo;</code> behave as if you had also written <code>Class-&gt;PREPARE($foo)</code>, if there was such a method. If you had <code>my Class $foo = 'bar'</code> instead, the assignment would occur after the <code>PREPARE</code> call.</p>

<p>Sarathy did not like the implementation, for reasons I did not completely understand. Sarathy did not like that an <code>AUTOLOAD</code> call would be made at compile time if <code>PREPARE</code> was not found where it was supposed to be. Ilya did this by analogy with <code>DESTROY</code>, but the compile-time call to <code>AUTOLOAD</code> is peculiar. (Sarathy: ``Yikes!&ldquo;) Sarathy also objected to the way that the check for <code>PREPARE</code> was done at compile time, rather than at run time; Ilya said he did it that way for efficiency so that the check would not have to be done every time the declaration was executed.</p>

<p>Sarathy also complained that even though most uses of <code>my Class $foo</code> would not involve <code>PREPARE</code>, the compiler would have to make an <code>AUTOLOAD</code> call for each one of them. Ilya appeared to agree that this was a problem. Sarathy suggested a pragma that declares the <code>PREPARE</code> method for a class. Ilya pointed out that if the autloading part was removed from his patch, then the definition of the <code>PREPARE</code> subroutine itself would serve as exactly such a pragma.</p>

<p>An interesting sidetrack developed: Chip said it would be simpler in Topaz if the argument to <code>PREPARE</code> were <code>\$foo</code> rather than just <code>$foo</code>. Ilya said he did not want to do that because constructing a reference costs as much as 21 `simple&rsquo; operations. What this means is: Perl takes a certain amount of time to dispatch each operation. For some `simple&rsquo; operations, such as performing a scalar assignment, the time to actually perform the operation is dominated by the opcode dispatch time, so they all take about the same amount of time. Constructing a scalar reference, according to Ilya, takes 21 times as long as one of these `simple&rsquo; operations, and constructing an array reference takes 50 times as long. Chip was surprised, and so am I.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-goto-goto-out-of-conditional-bug-span"><span id="goto">goto Out of Conditional Bug</span></h3>

<p>Damien Neil reported a bug in 5.005_03 that is triggered when you use <code>goto</code> out of a conditional block. He also supplied a patch. Watch out for Damien&amp;#151newcomers who provide core patches are people to pay attention to.</p>

<p>Sarathy said that this was already fixed in the development version. His solution is a little different. Damien&rsquo;s patch wraps up each branch of the <code>if</code> as a separate block; Sarathy&rsquo;s wraps up the entire <code>if</code> as one block. Sarathy wants to keep his patch because it makes the op tree smaller and so the code is faster at run time. But he notes that Damien&rsquo;s approach might be better if the peephole optimizer could be instructed to remove the extra instructions for blocks that do not contain <code>goto</code>.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-range-regex-range-bug-span"><span id="range">Regex Range Bug</span></h3>

<p>Faisal Nasim had trouble with a regex that included <code>[\w-]</code> and <code>[\w-.]</code>. Different versions of Perl behaved differently for this, depending on whether the <code>-</code> was seen as indicating a range or not. 5.005_03 interpreted it as if you had written <code>[\w\-.]</code>; 5.005_62 generated a syntax error. (``Invalid range&rdquo;.) This was Jarkko&rsquo;s doing. Opinions varied about what behavior was best, especially since the documentation seemed to support the latter view&amp;#151but the changed behavior broke old code, as Faisal pointed out.</p>

<p>Larry suggested making it a warning. Jarkko thought this was peachy and put in the patch. While on the subject, he put in a warning for use of <code>\A</code> etc. in character classes.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-lib-use-lib-change-span"><span id="lib">use lib change</span></h3>

<p>Tod Irwin wants <code>use lib 'foo'</code> to append <code>foo</code> to the front of <code>@INC</code> (which it does already) and to also remove any <em>other</em> appearances of <code>foo</code> that happen to be in <code>@INC</code> already. His motivation: <code>mod_perl</code> scripts that have <code>use lib</code> have <code>@INC</code> lists that get longer and longer and longer.</p>

<p>There were some objections, but the change is in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nick Ing-Simmons:</strong> Modules which inject things into <code>@INC</code> are highly suspect beasts - its like lacing the fruit juice with vodka.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="span-id-pack-more-discussion-about-documentation-for-pack-span"><span id="pack">More discussion about documentation for pack</span></h3>

<p>A discussion about the documentation for <code>pack</code> finished up. I wouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned this, except:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarathy:</strong> What would you suggest [the format specifier] <code>@*</code> should mean?</p>

<p><strong>Ilya:</strong> Call the cops.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="span-id-microperl-microperl-span"><span id="microperl">MicroPerl</span></h3>

<p>This almost slipped by me, but I wrote to ask Ilya what it was about. Here&rsquo;s what he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Build Perl without Configure support. First you build a bastardized version (nanoperl), use it to build a correctly working version with some functionality missing (microperl), then use this to run <code>Configure.PL</code> which will make an analogue of <code>config.sh</code>, then you continue with miniperl and perl as before.</p>

<p>The supplied target crazyperl is <em>very</em> close to become nanoperl of the above classification. Minor changes to supplied <code>micro0/config.sh</code> should (when bugs are ironed out) produce a microperl.</p>

<p>Currently crazyperl passes a lot of tests. This should be improved yet more (apparently the code <em>is</em> there to support the situation when no non-portable services are found, but it has some bugs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t you glad I asked? I sure am.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-various-various-span"><span id="various">Various</span></h3>

<p>Also a large collection of bug reports, bug fixes, questions, answers, and a small amount of flamage and spam.</p>

<p>Until next week I remain, your humble and obedient servant,</p>
