      <title>A New Edition of www.perl.com</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/pub/1999/07/newperl.html/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/pub/1999/07/newperl.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to welcome you to this new edition of www.perl.com and tell you about some of the changes we made to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier Navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simplified the navigation menu so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to find the site&amp;rsquo;s major sections and functions. This menu consists of the following choices: Download, Documentation, CPAN, FAQS, Marketplace, Features and Search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Features for Home Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home page contains a number of new things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several feature articles;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a list of short news items;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Perl Cookbook recipe of the day;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an area that features a Larry Wall quote which changes when you re-load;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a list of Larry&amp;rsquo;s talks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a list of new items from Tom Christiansen called Perlland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a list of commonly asked questions, mainly about the site or about the Perl market, questions that are not typically answered in the FAQ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also find the Perl Reference on the www.perl.com home page It&amp;rsquo;s organized as a hierarchy for the topics. An alphabetical list of topics is also available as a drop-down box on the main menu.
&lt;strong&gt;Better Access to Perl Documentation and FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new site organizes Perl documentation, improving format and consistency of the HTML versions of Perl man pages as well as the FAQs. We hope this makes the core documentation more accessible for those who want to use it in a Web browser. We&amp;rsquo;ve also catalogued the individual documentation files so that you will be able to search for them more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site&amp;rsquo;s search engine now looks across the site to return documentation, feature articles as well as items found in the Perl Reference. The engine is not very efficient right now but we&amp;rsquo;ll work on it. We intend to provide a better search engine soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Download Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of new users stumble through the process of downloading Perl. We&amp;rsquo;ve re-written the download instructions in hopes that new users will find it easier select the right source or binary to download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Perl Marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of www.perl.com now has the Perl Marketplace, in which you&amp;rsquo;ll find new products and services for the Perl community. Our coverage isn&amp;rsquo;t complete yet, so let us know if there are products which should be listed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what you like and don&amp;rsquo;t like about the new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,
Dale&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microsoft to Fund Perl Development</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/pub/1999/06/activestate.html/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/pub/1999/06/activestate.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the good news is that the world&amp;rsquo;s largest software company has recognized the value of Perl and they are willing to fund new Perl development, then you know the bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has entered into a three-year agreement with ActiveState Tool Corp. to fund development of Perl, most of which will be released as open source code. The intention of the agreement is to improve Perl on the Windows platform. ActiveState will add features previously missing from Windows ports of Perl, such as an implementation of &lt;em&gt;fork&lt;/em&gt;, as well as full support for Unicode on Windows platforms, a key feature for international users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/_pub_1999_06_activestate/aslogo.gif&#34; width=&#34;136&#34; height=&#34;60&#34; /&gt;Dick Hardt of ActiveState believes that this announcement represents a formal endorsement of Perl by Microsoft, which should help Perl gain greater recognition. &amp;ldquo;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s main motive,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;is to improve interoperability between Unix and Windows.&amp;rdquo; The announcement can also be viewed as Microsoft getting its feet wet with supporting Open Source software on Windows. Yet Hardt knows that some are leery of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s interest in Perl, especially in light of Sun&amp;rsquo;s battle with Microsoft over Java. He insists that the examples of Java and Perl are very different. &amp;ldquo;We are not producing &amp;lsquo;Microsoft Perl&amp;rsquo; under this deal,&amp;rdquo; said Hardt. &amp;ldquo;It won&amp;rsquo;t become a Microsoft product. In addition, the Unix and Windows versions of Perl will not diverge. They will continue to be produced from the same core source code.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gurusamy Sarathy, one of the original developers of the Windows port of Perl who now works for ActiveState, said that he felt comfortable with the arrangement. &amp;ldquo;Microsoft is interested in the end result, not in controlling the development process,&amp;rdquo; he said. Hardt added that Microsoft has been funding Perl development through ActiveState since 1995. The current agreement is a sign that the relationship has been a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to ActiveState, the new development will applied in the following areas: �&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extend Perl&amp;rsquo;s support for Unicode to all system calls so that Perl can interface with file names and environment variables as Unicode data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide a functionally equivalent implementation of fork, a Unix system call which does not exist on NT systems. �&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve the performance of Perlscript by saving the state of a compiled script for a subsequent script. This will help Perl match VBscript and JavaScript performance in the ASP environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add support for the new Microsoft installer, which is a requirement for Windows 2000 compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Perl Support for XML Developing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/pub/1998/06/perl-xml.html/</link>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-make-perl-the-language-of-choice-for-xml&#34;&gt;How to Make Perl The Language of Choice for XML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl has been the language of choice for anyone doing serious text processing. Now efforts are underway to make Perl the language of choice for those doing &amp;ldquo;structured&amp;rdquo; text processing using the Extensible Markup Language (XML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/tr/1998/rec-xml-19980210&#34;&gt;XML 1.0 specification&lt;/a&gt; was recently (Feb. 10, 1998) released as a recommendation by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/&#34;&gt;World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/a&gt;. XML is a subset of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) and it seems to be emerging as a universal syntax for defining non-proprietary document markup and data formats. XML made significant changes to SGML to reflect the nature of the Web and to make it easier to build tools that process XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Bray, co-editor of the XML 1.0 specification, has used Perl extensively for huge text processing applications. He had a special interest in seeing a bridge built from Perl to XML &amp;ndash; one that would make it simple for programmers to process XML data. So, out of this interest, a small group of developers met at O&amp;rsquo;Reilly &amp;amp; Associates in Sebastopol, California for a one-day Perl/XML summit. In addition to Tim, those attending the summit were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larry Wall, creator of Perl, and senior developer, O&amp;rsquo;Reilly &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dick Hardt, developer of Perl for Win 32, and Chief Technology Officer, ActiveState Tool Corp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim O&amp;rsquo;Reilly, President and CEO, O&amp;rsquo;Reilly &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dale Dougherty, CEO, Songline Studios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gina Blaber, Director, Software Products Group, O&amp;rsquo;Reilly &amp;amp; Associates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the design of XML, we were continuously mindful of the need to enable the fast, efficient creation of scripts and programs for processing XML,&amp;rdquo; says Tim Bray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For many of us in the XML effort, the most important goal is to increase the proportion of the world&amp;rsquo;s documents stored in open, non-proprietary formats,&amp;rdquo; Bray continues. &amp;ldquo;Building slick XML processing into Perl makes the use of such formats more rewarding and helps frustrate the efforts of those who would imprison human knowledge behind the barbed-wire of proprietary file formats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;XML is currently perceived as powerful and important, but not particularly easy,&amp;rdquo; explains Larry Wall. &amp;ldquo;This makes XML and Perl naturally complementary, since Perl is a language that makes easy things easy to do, and hard things possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps that the summit group identified was to get Perl working with Unicode (ISO 10646). Unicode enables code to be easily translated into other languages; XML requires Unicode. Larry Wall will lead the team working on this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is figuring out at what level Perl actually provides support for XML: whether it&amp;rsquo;s built into the language, implemented as a module or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the goals set at the meeting were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release a Perl/XML spec in Q3, 1998.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a mailing list for discussion of Perl and XML developer issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop an XML white paper, co-authored by Larry Wall and Tim Bray, to be released this spring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in these efforts, you might want to attend the Perl and XML session at the XML Developer&amp;rsquo;s Day in Seattle at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gca.org/&#34;&gt;The XML Conference&lt;/a&gt; on March 27, 1998. Larry Wall and Dick Hardt will be speaking. The Perl Developer Update will also keep track of new announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
